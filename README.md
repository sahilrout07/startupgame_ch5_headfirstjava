# Startup game 
This is the startup game from chapter 5 of the book Head First Java.


**Goal**  
Sink the startup in the fewest numbers of guesses.

**Setup**  
When the game program is launched, the computer places a startup randomly, on the virtual 1x7 grid. When the setup is complete, the game asks for your first guess. 

**How to play**  
This is a command line interface. The computer will prompt the user to enter a guess (a cell). The user enters a cell ("3", 4", etc.). In response to the guess a response of "hit", "miss", or "startup has been killed" will be displayed to the user, when the startup has been killed the game ends by printing the result (number of guesses).

My Comments
---
This is a game from Chapter 5 and requires some knowledge from Chapter 6 of Head First Java.  Most of the code is from the book.  I did make improvements and changes like adding arrayList instead of array.  
**output**  
output will look like this  
![output](output.png"a title")
